# Using the Gimhook SDK

To use the Gimhook SDK, you will first need to install Node.js and Git:

- https://nodejs.org/en/download
- https://git-scm.com/downloads

Then, create a new directory and run `npm init gimhook@latest` inside of it to bootstrap a new mod.

Once you've created it, edit the code and add the features you want into your mod.

You can run `npm run build` to create a development build of your mod, and `npm run dist` to create a production build.

Then, you can install `dist/index.js` using the Gimhook Mod Manager UI.
