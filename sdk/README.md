# Gimhook SDK

This is the SDK for Gimhook. It contains everything that you need to make and publish a gimhook mod.

# How do I use it?

First of all, you need Node.js installed. Install it if you don't already have it.

Then, create a new directory and run `npm init gimhook@latest` inside of it to bootstrap a new mod.

Once you've created it, edit the code and add what you want in your mod.

When you're ready to test it, run `npm run build` to build the mod and then import `dist/index.js` into the Gimhook desktop app.
